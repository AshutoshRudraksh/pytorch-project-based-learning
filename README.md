# ðŸ§  PyTorch 6-Day Learning Challenge

Welcome to the **PyTorch 6-Day Learning Challenge**! This repository is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, in just six days. Whether you're a beginner or looking to solidify your PyTorch skills, this structured program combines daily learning materials with hands-on mini-projects to accelerate your understanding and practical experience.

## ðŸ“… Overview

Over the course of six days, you'll explore key PyTorch concepts, implement neural networks, handle datasets, optimize models, and delve into advanced topics like transfer learning and deployment. Each day is structured with:

- **Learning Materials:** Comprehensive notes, tutorials, and scripts to build your foundational knowledge.
- **Mini-Project:** A practical project to apply what you've learned and reinforce your skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

```
pytorch-6-day-learning/
â”œâ”€â”€ basics_learning/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day3/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day4/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day5/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ day6/
â””â”€â”€ projects/
    â”œâ”€â”€ day1_project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ day2_project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ day3_project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ day4_project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ day5_project/
    â””â”€â”€ day6_project/
```

- **`basics_learning/`**: Contains daily learning materials, including notes and example scripts for each day's topics.
- **`projects/`**: Hosts the mini-projects corresponding to each day, allowing you to apply your knowledge in practical scenarios.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to embark on your PyTorch learning journey:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytorch-6-day-learning.git
   cd pytorch-6-day-learning
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

3. **Navigate Through the Days:**

   - **Day 1:**
     - Explore `basics_learning/day1/` for learning materials.
     - Implement the *Tensor Operations Playground* in `projects/day1_project/`.
     - Commit and push your progress.

   - **Subsequent Days:**
     - Repeat the pattern: study the materials, work on the project, and commit your changes.

4. **Commit Your Progress:**

   Make regular commits with descriptive messages to track your learning journey.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Day 1: Completed Tensor Operations Playground"
   git push origin main
   ```
